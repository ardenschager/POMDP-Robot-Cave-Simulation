# POMDP-Robot-Cave-Simulation

This project was part of CS 238: Decision Making Under Uncertainty, an AI class at Stanford University. 

The final project was open-ended project so I chose to build a robotics simulation. 
The simulated robot navigates through a 2d cave (generated with automata) towards a target at the end. 
The robot has faulty sensors, and the cave occasionally collapses. 
The entire project was an exercise to test the POMDP algorithm and also to build something cool.
